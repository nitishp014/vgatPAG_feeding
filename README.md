This code accompanies the manuscript entitled "Periaqueductal gray GABAergic neurons dynamically promote consumption according to food value". To run, first download the miniscope data: http://datadryad.org/share/LINK_NOT_FOR_PUBLICATION/XmZMBTz9rDaFfevWu-tlwGHzTiWfMj8sq5vIrYiTfyc.

Then be sure to relink to the local file directory for each recording sessions, at the top of each code. Run each code file, in its entirety, to recreate the associated figures.

The code was written using Matlab 2023a. The expected runtime for all code should be much less than 1 minute. The expected output will be either similar or identical to the related manuscript figures.
